# CSCI-342

In this class we learn about the programming language of C and the many restrictions and unresticted things that can be accomplished

## Tic-Tac-Toe V2
There are actually several versions of Tic Tac Toe, I actually created 3 Versions.
This version you can play with your friend in a one on one battle.
It uses threads to make a turn based game possible. Additionally the size of the board can change. \
If you change the LENGTH macro from 3 to any other value it should still work. 
(I have not tried it with lower values than three which could prove to be interesting.)

## Tic-Tac-Toe 2
This version you play against an AI. Not the smartest or a good AI but for a simple game it is nice. 
However, this one has a CPU opponent that tries to win and play "effectively".
I say "effectively" in quotes because the code is all my thinking and essentially no googling or researching the best / fastest way.
I wanted to take the challenge and figure out if I could do it. You can still trap the rudimentary AI but it still works.
It is an offensive AI that tries to take the most "winning" move given the current board state and does not really hold back.
