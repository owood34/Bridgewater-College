# CSCI-342

In this class we learn about the programming language of C and the many restrictions and unresticted things that can be accomplished

## Tic-Tac-Toe 2
If you cannot tell by the name of the C file. This is version 2 of my Tic Tac Toe Game. I actually created 3 Versions.
However, this one has a CPU opponent that tries to win and play "effectively".
I say "effectively" in quotes because the code is all my thinking and essentially no googling or researching the best / fastest way.
I wanted to take the challenge and figure out if I could do it. You can still trap the rudimentary AI but it still works.
It is an offensive AI that tries to take the most "winning" move given the current board state and does not really hold back.
