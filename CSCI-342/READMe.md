# CSCI-342

## Tic-Tac-Toe
If you see the name of the file you can tell that I have made Tic-Tac-Toe the game more than once.
It was actually 3 different versions of Tic-Tac-Toe. I show this one as it has a working CPU opponent
that tries to win. Yes, the code could be smaller, however, I did this on my own without google.
